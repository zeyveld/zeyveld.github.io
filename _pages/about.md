I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Michigan State University, specializing in Industrial Organization and Applied Econometrics. My current research concerns consumer learning, demand estimation with micro data, and choice-set dependence.

I will be joining <a href="https://www.bateswhite.com/">Bates White</a> as an Economist later this year.
